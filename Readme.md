The project repository consist of 3 files:

1. run_analysis.R: This is a R code that performs the following 5 steps as per the requirements:
                   a) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
                   b) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
                   c) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
                   d) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
                   e) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average                        of each variable for each activity and each subject.

2. CodeBook.md: This will list all the variables used in the above R code.
3. tidy_data_set.txt: This is a independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
